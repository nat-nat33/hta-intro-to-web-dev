A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to complete a task. "Coding" or "programming, means writing the step by step instructions that tell the computer what to do.

## What is Computer Software?
Everything a computer does, from browsing the internet to writing documents of playing musicc, works because of the code written by a computer programmer. Software can be found in so many things we use everyday.

- Game consoles are just another type of computer. All the games that run on them are programs. The graphics, sounds, and controls are written in computer code.
- Washing machines are programmed to follow different cycles. Computer code controls how hot the water is and how long the wash takes.
- In some cars, computer programs monitor the speed, temperature, and amount of fuel in the tank. Computer programs can even help control the breaks to keep people safe.
